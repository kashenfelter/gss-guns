This is a script that grabs some data from GSS, particularly on the issue of gun control. I estimate some mixed effects models that show that GOP partisanship does not robustly reduce support for gun control and that most Republicans actually support multiple gun control measures. However, the issue has become more polarizing since 2010 than it was previously.

I discuss the analysis further [on my blog](http://svmiller.com/blog/2015/12/gun-control-public-opinion-1972-2014/).
